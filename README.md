# lifeline

Visualise and track key life events with an interactive timeline

## Developer Guide

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| npm run lint | Lint the code with eslint/prettier |
| npm run lint:fix | Fix the code with eslint/prettier |


## Goals

- Build multiple timelines of key life events
- Events might be: where I lived, work, travel, holidays, climbing, medical, etc
- Events can be major or minor, to allow a high level view or detailed view
- Filter that lets you choose which lifelines to show

## Building the line

Could be text based:

```
2021-01-01: home - *moved to UK*
2021-02-03: home - lived in US for a week
```

## TODO

Quick and dirty task list:

- [ ] refactor: initial page structure with joyui
